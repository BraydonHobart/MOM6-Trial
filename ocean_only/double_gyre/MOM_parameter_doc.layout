!SYMMETRIC_MEMORY_ = False      !   [Boolean]
                                ! If defined, the velocity point data domain includes
                                ! every face of the thickness points. In other words,
                                ! some arrays are larger than others, depending on where
                                ! they are on the staggered grid.  Also, the starting
                                ! index of the velocity-point arrays is usually 0, not 1.
                                ! This can only be set at compile time.
!STATIC_MEMORY_ = False         !   [Boolean]
                                ! If STATIC_MEMORY_ is defined, the principle variables
                                ! will have sizes that are statically determined at
                                ! compile time.  Otherwise the sizes are not determined
                                ! until run time. The STATIC option is substantially
                                ! faster, but does not allow the PE count to be changed
                                ! at run time.  This can only be set at compile time.

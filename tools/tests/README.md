# How to run Python tests

This directory contains model tests written in Python. You can run these tests with:
```
$ py.test
```
Or a subset of the tests with:
```
$ py.test <test_file.py>
```
Also see:
```
$ py.test --help
```
Pay particular attention to the 'custom options' section.

If you don't have py.test installed on your machine, then you can do all of the above by replacing py.test with: python runtest.py
